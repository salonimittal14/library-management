# Library Management System

## 1. Introduction

A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to automate and manage the day-to-day operations of a library. It assists librarians in efficiently organizing, cataloging, and tracking library resources, including books, journals, and multimedia materials. The primary objective of an LMS is to streamline library operations, enhance user experience, and improve overall efficiency in managing library resources.

### 1.1 Features

- **Database Management:** Maintain a comprehensive database of library resources, including information about new acquisitions, borrowed items, and due dates.
- **Automated Processes:** Streamline tasks such as book indexing, cataloging, reservations, and notifications to users.
- **Categorization:** Organize library resources into categories, subjects, authors, and topics for easy navigation and retrieval.
- **User Management:** Manage library memberships, issue library cards, and handle user requests and inquiries.
- **Admin Panel:** Provides administrative functionalities such as user registration, managing library resources, generating reports, and maintaining records.
- **Student Panel:** Allows students to search for books, view book details, reserve and borrow books, renew borrowed items, and analyze their transaction history.
- **Faculty Staff Panel:** Similar to the student panel, tailored for faculty and staff members, enabling them to access library resources and perform relevant tasks.

## 3. Instruction to Run Project

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following software tools and dependencies are installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- **Mongo DB:** NoSQL database used for storing and managing library data.
- **Chrome:** Web browser for accessing and interacting with the web-based application.
- **VS Code (optional):** Integrated development environment (IDE) for code editing and project management.

### 3.2 Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Download git repositary:**

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Open the backend folder in VS Code or any preferred text editor.
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the backend folder.
   - Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the backend server:
     ```
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Open the frontend folder in VS Code or any preferred text editor.
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the frontend folder.
   - Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the frontend server:
     ```
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser (preferably Chrome) and navigate to the following URL:
     ```
     localhost:5173
     ```

### 3.3 Admin Credentials

Use the following credentials to access the admin panel of the application:

- **Email:** admin@gmail.com
- **Password:** admin

### 3.4 Note

- When the admin creates a new student or faculty member, a random password is generated and an email notification is sent to the respective user's email address. The email contains information about their account creation and instructions to change their password.

## 4. Conclusion
